**1. What's your hypothesis about what's going on here?**
Amazon does have users interacting with the auto purchase section and does have  users aspiring to purchase cars, but data shows users are purchasing the little accessories: auto stickers, motor oil, and wiper blades, for some reason  users are leaving the automobile purchase section.

**2.Based on your hypothesis, detail your next steps. How will you approach this challenge? What needs to be done?**

The business goal is to sell more cars and more spare parts for cars, through a customer journey people who buy car  require advice  and a more detailed customer service. 

**Pain points:**

* Today Navigation is confusing: users do circle navigation or get lost within the various sections; the outcome is that users drop the purchase.
* Users struggle to find desired accessories.
* Amazon car sections is attracting traffic but not real buyers, lack of services and advices.

**Next steps:**

* Unify Vehicle garage and Amazon vehicles,
* Ass all other amazon sections give the option to put a vehicle in your cart easily. During testing it was hard to put in my amazon cart a vehicle: The two calls to actions are Add to list or View in your garage, It was hard to access a purchase section.
* After click on Add to basket Provide buying option easily and with more services: advice, best choice by user,  process of  purchasing, payments programs or credits, suggested accessories.  
* In order to engage the customer in the shopping experience the suggestion is  amazon cars  should follow the traditional shopping method of amazon: add to basket and payment agreement. The magic buy in 2 clicks.

**Challenges:**

* Visualize Amazon Vehicles as a leader in vehicle services, users are not used to purchase cars on Amazon
* Future evolution of software for the sale of more vehicles rather than spare parts and accessories: vans, trucks, cars & motorbikes, since they offer bigger sales margins.
* Use of the automation of users archetypes to create easy and agile shopping experience.
 
**To be done:**

* Lets call it Amazon Vehicle Services (AVS) 
* Study the MVP of AVS (Amazon Vehicle Services) to launch and test.
* Direct landing with automation by users archetypes  (previous Vehicle Garage).
* Visual look of a service platform with chat, technical support, shoppers advice...
* Provide direct option Add to basket, reproduce traditional Amazon good practice for these testing version of AVS (Amazon Vehicle Services).


 
**3. In detail, explain which data you’d like to get access to (data from Auto/vehicles existing users or other categories or sections of Amazon.com) in order to do your job?**

* I would like to compare time lapse for purchase on Amazon.com and purchase time lapse for Amazon vehicles, in order to lead the whole Automotive business into the track of Add to basket,   though it is a more complex product to sell try to have people purchasing cars like they do for socks, motor oil or tv. A solution for solving the complexity on purchasing decision is to have advice with chat or calls so customers feel more comfortable and secure and supported.
* Get access to quantitative data of users to create archetypes and lead sales easily by  types of users. 

Let’s assume you’ve also conducted 20 user interviews. Fabricate some fictitious data from both the user interviews and the data you mentioned in #3. What questions did you ask and how did the responses help you? Based on this data (and pulling from your own personal experience), provide some insights and recommendations to the Product Design and Business teams responsible for this category.
Let's play a  fictitious survey and results in order to be able to provide insights, based on the idea of AVS I would use a typeform or google forms with  4 simple questions, that helps lead to simple insights, so let's say these could be a first round of questionnaire:





**4.Insights and recommendations:** 

* People trust amazon as ecommerce  and 80% say they will purchase automobiles online.
* Users need advice and more customer service for purchasing automobiles online.
* People will swap their automobile often with amazon platform, seeing here a great business chance of car swapping.
* Users would like financial support advice via amazon for car purchasing.
